I designed and built a low-cost 3D spatial mapping system using a VL53L1X time-of-flight (ToF) distance sensor, a stepper motor, and an MSP-EXP432E401Y microcontroller. The system coordinated precise stepper motor rotation with synchronized distance measurements, capturing 64 data points per full 360° rotation across multiple depth levels to construct a volumetric representation of the environment. I implemented I²C communication between the microcontroller and the ToF sensor and UART communication to stream data to a PC. Custom MATLAB scripts were developed to parse serial data in real time, convert polar measurements into Cartesian coordinates, and generate live 3D visualizations of the scanned space.
